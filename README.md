iCub Tactile Grasp
=================

The Tactile Grasp is a module which perfors several types of object grasping using different levels of control and compliance.
Available grasping modes are:
 * Soft grasp
 * Tough grasp
 * Compliant grasp


##Soft Grasp
The Soft Grasp uses feedback from the fingertip tactile sensors to stop the grasping action once contact with an object is detected.


##Crush Grasp
The Crush Grasp does not use any feedback and will continue with the grasping action regardless if the fingertips are sensing anything.
